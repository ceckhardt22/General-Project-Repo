# The Final
Here is the final project worked on in Brosius' Visual Basic class during the 2nd term of the 2017-2018 school year. Isaiah and I decided to create a game that resembles something similar to Galaga or Space Invaders. However, we stumbled across many challenges, including time restraints, coding issues, and Isaiah having some conflicts with school. It is not necessarily a finished project; however, I have been able to make a working model.
